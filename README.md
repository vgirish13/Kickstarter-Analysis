# Kickstarting with Excel


## Overview of Project
This project teaches students to navigate pivot tables to efficiently filter through large data sets. Once we finalized filtered through the data based on the question parameters and made a 2-D line graph with data points. The relationships we observed were Theater outcomes by launch dates and outcomes based on a kick starterâ€™s goal.

### Purpose
The purpose of this research is to better understand key relationships within the  kick starter data set. This is important data to study within this industry because it allows for Louise's to be more successful. The key questions are when she needs to launch and  how meeting different funding goals affects a plays success. 

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Our analysis shows  that plays are more likely to be successful from April-August. May being  the most successful month with 111 successful plays out of 166 total plays. The chances of Louise's play being canceled are quite low with October having no canceled plays. However, January had the most cancelations at 7 plays. The average amount of plays that fail each month is 41. The highest month was in May at 52. The lowest failing month was November at 31. The most successful range 

### Analysis  of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis on success rates is incredibly important because it allows for Louise to set more realistic expectations for the plays funding. My analysis found that as the funding increased plays tended to fail. Above $40,000 plays had the highest rate of failure. The 45,000+ range had a 100% failure rate. The most successful range was the less than $5,000 range with 72.66% success rate.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I thought the first deliverable was pretty self explanatory.  I did have  issues  with deliverable 2. I thought the data set was just harder to read and there were more columns to filter through. This became very tedious within excel; however, I believe it was good practice and beneficial towards my excel profiency.

## Results

-What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
I believe that the data is strongly suggesting that launching plays in May, June, and July is the best option for Louise. May being the most ideal month to launch. Another conclusion I made was that launching in October sets Louise up for failure. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals
The data suggests that the successrate is negatively correlated with the amount of money spent. There are outliers in the $35,000-$45,000 range. Therefore, I would suggest to Louise to either plan for a lower budget play or a play within the $35,000-$44,999 range. My other conclusion is to aggressively avoid going over the $45,000 range because most plays fail with this budget. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation on this data set for our research question would be the location of these plays. If we had this information, we can pinpoint exact areas that are ideal for success. Another limitation to this data set would be the amount of people involved with a production. If we knew this information we could be better positioned towards success. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can create a graph looking at the correlation between currency and success. Also, we can change the paramaters to just look at any of the genres given to analyze their success factors. For example, we can analyze the connection between video games release date and success.
